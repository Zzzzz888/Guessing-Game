# Unit 1 Guessing Game
# 1. Import the random module

import random

boolean=True

# 2b. Create a variable that stores the result of input provided by the user, ask them to - "Type a number for an upper bound: "

  if num.isdigit():

  else:

# 3c. "Scrub" the value of the entered number, by setting it to an int 
    
# 3d. Write the else condition and give the user an error message

# TEST IT OUT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH DIFFERENT INPUTS

# 4. Generate a random number from the range 1 to the number the user entered, make sure it is outside your while loop - known as a global variable

# 5. Create two more variables - one for the guess and one for the count of guesses

  # 7. Verify the guess is a number (like before) and if it is, update the guess variable to be the value of itself as an int
    
    
   
  # 8. Check it! Make an if else statement to see if guess equals the random number, if it does tell the user they won! If it does not, update the guess count number by 1

# 10. Make the game playable more than once, add a while loop around all of your code
